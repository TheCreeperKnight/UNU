# UNU
UNU:Unoffical Nether Mod is a Minecraft nether mod that adds some much needed content to the nether.
It is mainly going to be for beta/alpha packages (Like, testing or unstable versions) the main content is gonna be here:
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/unu-unofficial-nether-update
I am very open to suggestions, contrabutions etc.
This is a very new project on Github, on Curseforge it is about 3-4 weeks old now.
If I don't publish anything frequently, it is because I am working on something big.
